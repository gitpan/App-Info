App/Info version 0.05
=====================

App::Info provides a generalized interface for providing metadata about
software packages installed on a system. The idea is that App::Info subclasses
can be used in Perl application installers in order to determine whether
software dependencies have been fulfilled, and to get necessary metadata about
those software packages.

A few sample subclasses are provided with the distribution, but others are
invited to write their own subclasses and contribute them to the CPAN.
Contributors are welcome to extend their subclasses to provide more
information relevant to the application for which data is to be provided (see
App::Info::HTTPD::Apache for an example), but are encouraged to, at a minimum,
implement the methods defined by the App::Info abstract base class relevant to
the category of software they're managing, e.g. App::Info::HTTPD or
App::Info::RDBMS. New categories will be added as needed.
