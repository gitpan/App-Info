Revision history for Perl extension App::Info.

0.10  Wed Jun  5 23:58:54 2002
      - Added new error_level parameter to new(). This tells App::Info objects
        how to handle errors on an object-by-object basis. The new base class
        method error() is for subclasses to use for throwing errors, and
        last_error() is for client code to access the last error in non-fatal
        error modes. See App::Info for complete documentation. This is the major
        change the triggered the (mild) version number jump.
      - Reworked all application subclasses to use the new error() method.
      - Changed all application subclasses so that they're no longer singleton
        classes. Each new object construction looks for application metatdata
        all over again.
      - Updated documentation on subclassing to reflect changes.
      - Added first_exe() and first_cat_exe() to App::Info::Util. Changed
        RDBMS::PostgreSQL, HTTP::Apache, and Lib::Iconv to use them.
      - Added more directories in which to search for the Apache server
        executable, thanks to work by Dave Rolsky.

      - Fixed all version tests in test scripts to check for definedness
        rather than truth, so that version numbers that are "0" will be
        ok. Thanks to Andy Lester for the spot.
      - Util now properly loads File::Spec rather than File::Spec::Functions.
      - Changed how the version number gets stored in Lib::Expat so that it
        only gets saved if all three version number parts are found.

0.05  Wed Jun  5 00:01:57 2002
      - Eliminated possible "Use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.)
        or string" warning from Lib::Expat.
      - Eliminated possible "Use of uninitialized value in hex" warning from
        Lib::Iconv.
      - Fixed issue where RDBMS::PostgreSQL would try to execute pg_config
        even when it didn't exist.
      - Added To Do list.
      - Made iconv.t and expat.t tests for version numbers safer for CPAN
        distribution. Patches with improved methods of determining version
        numbers for those libraries are welcome.

0.04  Tue Jun  4 01:03:58 2002
      - Wrote documentation on subclassing App::Info.
      - Added httpd_root() abstract method to App::Info::HTTPD abstract
        base class.
      - Added httpd_conf(), user(), group(), and port() methods to
        App::Info::HTTPD::Apche.
      - Added and corrected documentation in App::Info::HTTPD,
        App::Info::RDBMS, and App::Info::Lib.
      - Made minor documentation fixes to other classes.
      - Fixed methods in App::Info::Util to return undef in a scalar context
        if there were no regular expression matches.
